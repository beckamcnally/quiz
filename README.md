## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://beckamcnally.github.io/quiz/)

JavaScript Coding Quiz is a web application that allows coding students to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores. The quiz is multiple-choice and the user is presented with a series of questions. If the user selects the correct answer, they move on to the next question. If the user selects the wrong answer, time is subtracted from the clock. At the end of the quiz, the user can save their initials and score to compare their progress to their peers.
